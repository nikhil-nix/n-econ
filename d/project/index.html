		<summary><a>Geopolitics and Mode of International Collaboration (Dissertation Project)	 March - June 2023</a></summary>

<ul><li>under the guidance of Prof Sugata Marjit (First Distinguished Professor of IIFT)</li><br>
	<li>I explored the strategic importance of international collaboration in mitigating risks arising from geopolitical tensions and other idiosyncratic factors, such as the impact of COVID-related border closures. I developed a game-theoretical framework to illustrate how the international relations of parent countries can influence multinational corporations to form International Joint Ventures (IJVs) as a risk mitigation strategy. This study highlighted that economic parameters alone might not suffice, as the possibility of tariff imposition due to strained international relations is primarily influenced by geopolitics.</li>

	<summary><a>CAPM verification in base R	 Jan - Feb 2023</a></summary>
<ul><li>Dr AKS Chand, Prof of Economics, IIFT Delhi</li><br>
<li>I conducted a rigorous analysis to verify the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using the R programming language. By collecting and analyzing closing prices of S&P 500 BSE stocks over 15 years, I calculated annualized returns and built a variance-covariance matrix. Additionally, I determined monthly returns for the S&P 500 BSE and performed regression analysis to empirically test the Security Market Line.</li>

	<summary><a>Impact of India’s Trade Liberalization on Income Inequality	Oct - Dec 2022</a></summary>

	<ul><li>	Dr. Basanta K. Sahu, Professor & Head Economics Division, IIFT Delhi</li>
					<br>	<li>This project examines the causal relationship between India's trade liberalization and income inequality while controlling for various income inequality factors. I employed programmed loops in R to calculate Gini coefficients and visualized the relationship between trade openness and income inequality trends over time using trade-to-GDP ratios.</li>

	<summary><a>Time Zone Differences, Service Trade, and Implications for Factor Prices (Paper Presentation)	 Sep - Oct 2022</a></summary>
		<ul><li>Prof Sugata Marjit (First Distinguished Professor of IIFT)	</li>
			<br><li>I presented a paper that delved into the impact of time zone differences on international trade and factor markets. By introducing a new dimension to existing trade theories, I explined how time-saving improvements in business-services trade can lead to economic growth, extending beyond conventional trade models.

	<summary><a>Estimating Rybczynski elasticity for the case of South Korea using Prof Jones’s concept	 Aug - Oct 2022</a></summary>
					<ul><li>Dr Ranajoy Bhattacharyya, Prof of International Trade, IIFT Kolkata</li>
<br><li>This project extended the analysis of Rybczynski's theorem to study variations in quantities of two factors of production using Prof. Jones's concept. I collected extensive time series data, performed statistical tests for stationarity, estimated GDP with the translog method, and ran sector-wise time series regression to determine factor endowments and intensities.</li>

						<summary><a>Analyzing Intensive and Extensive Margins, Price, Quantitative Margin, and RCA for HS-710239 Diamonds	    Aug - Oct 2022</a></summary>
						<ul><li>Prof Biswajit Nag, HOD(Economics & Trade Policy), IIFT Delhi</li>
						<br>	<li>This project involved a comprehensive analysis of India's trade in HS-710239 Diamonds (excluding industrial diamonds) from 2002 to 2019. I assessed the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) between India and partner countries, evaluated intensive and extensive margins, analyzed price and quantitative margins, and highlighted India's trade dynamics in the diamond sector.
