1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,042
Nothing to be done. I'm
beginning to come round in that

2
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:09,582
opinion. All my life, I've
tried to put it from me saying,

3
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:12,182
Vladimir, be reasonable. You
haven't yet tried everything

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:18,122
and I resumed at the struggle.
We should have thought of it a

5
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:20,402
million years ago when the
world was young. Stop

6
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:24,122
bladdering and help me off with
this bloody thing. Hand in hand

7
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:28,342
from the top of the Eiffel
Tower among the first. We were

8
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:31,462
presentable in those days. Now
it's too late. They wouldn't

9
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:36,582
even let us up. Oh. What are
you doing? Taking off me boot.

10
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:40,582
Did that never happen to you?
Boots must be taken off every

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,662
day. I'm tired telling you
that. Why don't you listen to

12
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:45,942
me? Help me. It hurts. Hurts.
He wants to know if it hurts.

13
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:49,062
No one ever suffers but you. I
don't count. I'd like to hear

14
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:52,182
what you'd say if you had what
I have. It hurts. Hurts. He

15
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:58,182
wants to know if it hurts. You
might button it all the same.
