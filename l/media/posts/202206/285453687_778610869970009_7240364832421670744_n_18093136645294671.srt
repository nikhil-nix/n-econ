1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:06,362
What do we do now? Wait? Yes,
but while waiting.

2
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:13,442
How about hanging ourselves? It
might give us an erection. An

3
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:17,842
erection with all that follows.
Where it falls, mandraids grow.

4
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:19,842
That's when they shriek when
you pull them up. Did you not

5
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:25,362
know that? Let's hang ourselves
immediately. From a barrel. I

6
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:28,162
wouldn't trust it. We could
always try and go ahead. Oh,

7
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,882
after you. No, no, you first.
Why me? You're lighter than I

8
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:35,242
am. Just so. I don't
understand. Use your

9
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:41,062
intelligence, can't you? I
remain in the dark. This is how

10
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:48,742
it is. The bell. Use your head
can't you? You're my only hope.

11
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:54,982
Go go light. Bow not break. Go
go dead. Dee Dee heavy. Bow

12
00:00:54,982 --> 00:00:58,662
break. Dee Dee alone. Whereas.
I haven't thought of that. If

13
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:01,782
it hangs you it'll hang any
