1
00:00:00,522 --> 00:00:04,542
Did you see? And now you turn
him away. Such an old,

2
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:07,342
unfaithful servant. Wine. After
having sucked all the good out

3
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:11,502
of him, you chuck him away like
a like a banana skin. Really? I

4
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:16,942
can't bear it. Any longer. The
way he goes on. You've no idea.

5
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:28,462
Mister I'm going mad. You must
go. I can't pay getting longer.

6
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:32,862
Can't hear it any longer. He's
going mad. It's terrible. How

7
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:36,702
dare you? It's abominable. Such
a good master. Crucify him like

8
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,982
that after so many years,
really. You used to be so kind,

9
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:44,942
so helpful, and entertaining my
good angel and now, he's

10
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:48,862
killing me. Does he want to
replace him? I don't know. Ask

11
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:52,542
him. Gentlemen, I don't know
what came over me. Forgive me.

12
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:56,622
Forget all that I said. I don't
remember exactly what it was

13
00:00:56,622 --> 00:01:01,802
but you may be sure there was a
word of truth in it.
