1
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:10,022
Was I sleeping while the others
suffered. Am I sleeping now?

2
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:17,942
Tomorrow when I wake. I think I
do. What shall I say of today?

3
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:20,902
That with Esthergon, my friend
at this place until the fall of

4
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:25,782
night, I waited for Gado. That
pot so passed with his carrier

5
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:28,902
and that he spoke to us?

6
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:36,242
But in all that, what truth
will there be? He'll know

7
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:40,002
nothing. He'll tell me about
the blows he received and I'll

8
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:47,522
give him a carrot. A stride of
a grave and a difficult birth.

9
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:51,362
Down in the hole lingeringly,
the grave digger puts on the

10
00:00:51,362 --> 00:01:00,482
forceps. We have time to grow
old. Full of our cries.
