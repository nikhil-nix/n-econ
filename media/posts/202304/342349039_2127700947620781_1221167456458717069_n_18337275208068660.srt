1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,422
Alright. Well, I went to the
zoo to find out more about the

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:08,822
way people exist with animals.
Animals with each other and

3
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:12,822
with people too. It probably
wasn't a fair test but with

4
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:16,582
everyone separated by bars from
everyone else but if it's a

5
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:21,622
zoo, that's the way it is. Move
over. I'm sorry, I thought you

6
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,902
had enough room. Well,

7
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:30,582
there. All the people, all the
children, everyone. It's a nice

8
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:36,262
day and all the animals are
there too. Move over. Okay, and

9
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:40,262
it's a hot day too. So, all the
stitches there too and all the

10
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:44,502
balloon cellars and all the ice
cream cellars and all the seals

11
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:50,502
are barking and all the birds
are screeching. Move over. Look

12
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:53,222
here, you have more than enough
room and I am there too and

13
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:56,662
it's feeding time in the lion's
house. One of the lion's houses

14
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:59,222
and one of the lion keepers
keeps coming in one of the

15
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:01,999
lion's cages to
