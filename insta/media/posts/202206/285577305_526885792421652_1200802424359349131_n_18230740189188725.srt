1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,462
Why don't we hang ourselves?
With what? You haven't got a

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:09,542
bit of rope. No. Then we can't.
Let's go. Oh wait. There's me

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:13,542
belt. It's too short. You could
always hang on to me legs. And

4
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:19,722
who'd hang on to mine? Uh Show
all the same.

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,542
Might do it a pinch but is it
strong enough? Where to see and

6
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,942
see?

7
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:34,682
Not worth a cut. You say we
have to come back tomorrow?

8
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:41,822
Yes. Then remind me to bring a
good bit of rope. Yeah, Dee

9
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:47,662
Dee. Yes. I can't go on like
this. That's what you think. If

10
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:52,142
we parted, it might be better
for us. We'll hang ourselves

11
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:58,682
tomorrow. Unless Goddo comes.
And if he comes? We'll be

12
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:01,242
saved.
