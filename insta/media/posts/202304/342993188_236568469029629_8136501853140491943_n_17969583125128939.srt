1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,182
That's the only word fourth
Peter, friend. So, I came in. I

2
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:10,742
saw the dog. I stared at him.
He stared at me. We stared at

3
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:15,942
each other for 20 seconds or 20
hours. I don't know how long it

4
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:21,462
was but we stared at each other
and during that time, we made a

5
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:26,582
connection. I felt for the dog.
Now, I loved him and I wanted

6
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:31,782
him to love me but we could
never be friends now, Peter. I

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:36,082
had tried to love and I had
tried to hurt and need had been

8
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:40,162
successful by themselves but
both together that was the

9
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:45,682
teaching emotion and what was
gained was lost so what have I

10
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:50,562
gained now solitary free
passage what is the guard dog

11
00:00:50,562 --> 00:01:00,582
gain now nothing I don't think
what we both gain is not
