00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:04,562
This is to sum up this whole
story Peter. Sum up the whole

2
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:10,842
thing. Was it the dog's attempt
to bite me not an act of love?

3
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:17,982
And was it my attempt to feed
the dog an active love? If we

4
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:22,782
can so misunderstand, why have
we invented the word love in

5
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:25,902
the first place?

6
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:35,822
So Peter, the story of Jerry
and the dog, The End. So, what

7
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:39,102
do you think, Peter? You think
I could sell that story to the

8
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:42,462
reader's digest and make a
couple hundred bucks for the

9
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:47,382
most interesting character I've
ever met? Hmm, Oh, come on

10
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:52,022
Peter. Tell me what you think.
I don't think I understand. Uh

11
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:57,382
why did you tell me all this?
Why not? I I don't
