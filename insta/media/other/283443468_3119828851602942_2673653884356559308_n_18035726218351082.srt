1
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:13,902
Bango's the big bang then the
darkness and thunder Adam and

2
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:18,542
Eve were strands of bacteria
blind we crawled with the birds

3
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:22,622
and the bees a few years on we
climb down from the trees and

4
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,622
we're standing in Africa
looking at the sky saying why

5
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:30,942
we here what happens when we
die we use god as a word for

6
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:34,622
the things we can't see now
plant some clothes and let's

7
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:38,382
wait for TV well it doesn't
take long till we're paying in

8
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:43,342
caves making some men king and
other men slaves saying god is

9
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:47,742
our reason and god is our
leader god spoke to me and he

10
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:51,662
told me to kill you we spread
like a virus to every dark

11
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:56,622
corner Greeks and Romans are
laying down borders slaves and

12
00:00:56,622 --> 00:01:01,422
the soldiers the queens and the
kings wherever they were used

13
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:03,902
to sing

14
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:17,182
weddings and wars that we are
good for if all of the past was

15
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:25,462
played as a song our lives are
a beat of the drum invading and

16
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:30,422
saving and trading the plunder
tobacco and opium tea leaves

17
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:34,742
and sugar empires built with
the bones of the slaughtered a

18
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:39,842
barrel of booze it return for
your daughters and burn the

19
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:48,642
weddings at war they songs they
sing jingle.

20
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:56,782
The same stars you can't hide
the beast that we

21
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:21,022
forgotten who's got the right
ones still singing and dancing

22
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:25,022
we're paying on canvas passing
the time with our sex and a

23
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:27,982
half island store.

24
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:34,142
Romeo and Juliet can't make it
work.

25
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,702
Someone invents the tea

26
00:02:55,022 --> 00:03:01,942
can't hide the beast that we
are instead of hunting now we

27
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:06,582
go to Tesco's instead of
talking now we wear headphones

28
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:11,302
instead of mountains we're
heading for Mars instead of god

29
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:18,122
we have credit cards and we're
2thousand and some peace

30
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:22,562
economy's crashing singing and
dancing and looking at the sky

31
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:29,482
saying why are we. Happens when
we die

32
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:46,322
the past was great as a song
and our lives are a beat of the

33
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:52,082
drum and our lives are a beat
of the drum
